## First: go read the [Begin Code of Conduct](https://github.com/smallwins/policy/blob/main/begin-community-code-of-conduct.md)

### Agreement to the Begin Community Code of Conduct
By participating and contributing to the Small Wins (aka Begin) community -- including, but not limited to its open source projects, any related online venues such as Github, Slack, and in-person events, etc. -- you agree to the [Begin Code of Conduct](https://github.com/smallwins/policy/blob/main/begin-community-code-of-conduct.md), found at the [Begin Policy archive](https://github.com/smallwins/policy). Lack of familiarity with this Code of Conduct is not an excuse for not adhering to it.
